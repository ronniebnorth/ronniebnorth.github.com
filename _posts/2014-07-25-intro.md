title: Introduction to the gfx-rs rendering API
---

The goal of the `gfx-rs` project is to make a high-performance, easy to use,
robust graphics API for the Rust programming language. Later posts will detail
show how we achieve that, but this one serves as a high-level introduction and
tutorial to `gfx-rs`. A basic familiarity with 3D graphics in general is
assumed (know what a vertex is). We'll walk through the [triangle
example](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/blob/master/src/examples/triangle/main.rs).

# Basic Setup

First we need some boilerplate to link to the libraries we need.

```rust
#![feature(phase)]

#[phase(plugin)]
extern crate gfx_macros;
extern crate gfx;
extern crate glfw;
```

Next, we define our vertex format. For this simple example, a 2D colored
triangle, we only need 2D coordinates and the color. The `#[vertex_format]`
attribute makes `gfx-rs` generate all of the glue code necessary for using our
custom type with the underlying graphics API:

```rust
#[vertex_format]
struct Vertex {
    pos: [f32, ..2],
    color: [f32, ..3]
}
```

# Creating a renderer

The first thing any `gfx-rs` program needs to do is get a window to render to.
Right now, only the `glfw` library is supported. We create an 800x600 window
using the lastest OpenGL version the graphics driver supports:

```rust
let glfw = glfw::init(glfw::FAIL_ON_ERRORS).unwrap();

let (mut window, events) = gfx::glfw::WindowBuilder::new(&glfw)
    .title("Welcome to gfx-rs!")
    .try_modern_context_hints()
    .create()
    .expect("Could not make window :(");
```

The next thing we need to do is create a renderer and a device:

```rust
let (renderer, mut device) = {
    let (context, provider) = gfx::glfw::Platform::new(window.render_context(), &glfw);
    gfx::start(context, provider, 1).unwrap()
};
```

The context provides buffer swapping, and the provider exposes GL extension
querying and function loading. The magic `1` is how many frames the renderer
will send before it blocks on the device. When `renderer.end_frame()` is
called, it will wait for a corresponding `device.update()` to finish
processing the frame.

The `device` abstracts over a specific graphics API and isn't that
interesting, but the `renderer` provides a high-level, easy to use interface.

Let's create a thread that will drive the `renderer`. This will allow the
device to still make progress on the sent draw calls while the renderer is
preparing more to send:

```rust
spawn(proc() {
    let mut renderer = renderer;
```

In order to begin drawing we'll need to prepare:

1. A `Frame` to render into.
2. A `DrawState`. We don't customize it here, but this tracks things like
   vertex winding order and how to do depth testing.
3. A mesh to draw.
4. A shader program to draw with.
5. The description of how we want to clear the `Frame` before we draw into it.

```rust
    let frame = gfx::Frame::new();
    let state = gfx::DrawState::new();
    let vertex_data = vec![
        Vertex { pos: [ -0.5, -0.5 ], color: [1.0, 0.0, 0.0] },
        Vertex { pos: [ 0.5, 0.5 ], color: [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]  },
        Vertex { pos: [ 0.0, 0.5 ], color: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]  }
    ];
    let mesh = renderer.create_mesh(vertex_data);
    let program = renderer.create_program(...);
    let bundle = renderer.bundle_program(program, ()).unwrap();

    let clear = gfx::ClearData {
        color: Some(gfx::Color([0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1.0])),
        depth: None,
        stencil: None
    };
```

The details of creating a shader program are skipped here, to be shown in a
later post.

We are now ready to write the renderer loop. This is a simple demo, so there
won't be much here. We'll clear the frame, draw the mesh, and then tell the
device that we have finished:

```rust
    while !renderer.should_finish() {
        renderer.clear(clear, frame);
        renderer.draw(&mesh, gfx::mesh::VertexSlice(0, 3), frame, &bundle, state)
                .unwrap();
        renderer.end_frame();
        for err in renderer.errors() {
            println!("Render error: {}", err);
        }
    }
})
```

Back in the main thread, we need to process the commands that the `renderer`
is sending:

```rust
while !window.should_close() {
    glfw.poll_events();
    // any event handling
    device.update();
}
device.close();
```

The `update` method will process any commands it has received from the
renderer. Compile and run, and you get:
