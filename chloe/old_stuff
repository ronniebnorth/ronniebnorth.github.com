                            The name comes from the Greek χλόη (khlóē), of the many names of the Greek goddess Demeter, and refers to the young, green foliage or shoots of plants.

                            Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the sacred law, and the cycle of life and death.

    <b>accompany (v.)</b>
    early 15c., "to be in company with," from Old French acompaignier "take as a companion" (12c., Modern French accompagner), from à "to" (see ad-) + compaignier, from compaign (see companion). Musical meaning "play or sing along with" is from 1570s. Related: Accompanied; accompanying.

    <b>companion (n.)</b>
    c. 1300, from Old French compagnon "fellow, mate, friend, partner" (12c.), from Late Latin companionem (nominative companio), literally "bread fellow, messmate," from Latin com "with, together" (see com-) + panis "bread," from PIE root *pa- "to feed."
    
    Found first in 6c. Frankish Lex Salica, and probably a translation of a Germanic word (compare Gothic gahlaiba "messmate," from hlaib "loaf of bread"). Replaced Old English gefera "traveling companion," from faran "go, fare."
